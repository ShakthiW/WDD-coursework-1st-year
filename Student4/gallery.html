        The field is typically made of natural or artificial grass and measures
        100-130 yards in length and 50-100 yards in width, depending on the
        level of play. The field is divided into two halves by a halfway line,
        and each half is further divided into two quarters by the center circle.
        The goals are located at either end of the field and consist of two
        vertical posts with a crossbar connecting them. The distance between the
        posts is 8 yards, and the height of the crossbar is 8 feet. The goal
        line is the line that runs along the width of the field at each end and
        marks the location of the goal. The penalty area is a rectangular area
        in front of each goal, and fouls committed inside the penalty area can
        result in a penalty kick. The corner arc is a small curved line at each
        corner of the field, where corner kicks are taken.
